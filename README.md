# Boole

Boole is a project that implements the principles of Boolean Algebra and Set Theory in a programming context. The project is designed to explore the operations and laws of Boolean logic and set manipulation through computational methods. It provides a solid foundation for anyone looking to understand how Boolean logic and set theory work together in computer science and mathematics.

## Features
- Boolean Algebra Operations: Perform operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and more on binary values.
- Set Theory Operations: Work with sets to perform union, intersection, difference, and complement operations.
- Interactive Examples: Use the project to experiment with different Boolean and set operations to reinforce your understanding.

## Boolean Algebra
Boolean algebra is a mathematical system that deals with binary variables, typically true (1) and false (0), and logical operations. It’s widely used in fields like computer science, digital circuits, and programming. Some key operations in Boolean algebra include:

- AND: A ∧ B – results in true if both A and B are true.
- OR: A ∨ B – results in true if at least one of A or B is true.
- NOT: ¬A – inverts the value of A.
- XOR: A ⊕ B – results in true if exactly one of A or B is true.
These operations follow specific laws like commutative, associative, and distributive laws.

## Set Theory
Set theory is a branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are collections of distinct objects. This project provides functions to perform set operations like:

- Union: A ∪ B – combines all elements from two sets.
- Intersection: A ∩ B – finds elements common to both sets.
- Difference: A - B – removes elements of set B from set A.
- Complement: A' – returns elements not in set A relative to a universal set.

## Installation
